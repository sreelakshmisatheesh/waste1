              <h5 class="card-title"> The Truman Show(1998) [AUTHOR- ABHIRAM D H, 05-01-2022,5.45 PM]</h5>
              <p class="card-text">This 1998 scifi thriller drama directed by Peter Weir revolves around Truman(played by a Jim Carrey in supreme form) where he is not aware of the fact that his whole life is a TV show. I find Truman show to be a multi layered piece of artwork. The outer layer being a truly nail-biting scifi comedy thriller and if you dig deeper it is an existential drama that deals with various socio political issues like media addiction and corporate influence on everyday lives.  In this age of internet and reality shows, the themes that this movie dealt with seems prophetic and more relevant than ever.

              <p class="card-text">
                Some of the most popular and innocent children's games in the 1970's and 1980's South Korea (played in the alleys) get reinvented (modern day) as a mysterious survival game with a 45.6 billion won cash prize for the winner. There's a catch however: losers must pay... with their lives!                                                                                 As a group of 456 financially desperate people voluntarily risk their lives for the penultimate prize by participating in six twisted games Squid Game, in the words of writer-director Hwang Dong-hyuk, is a dark and macabre take on 'modern capitalism' that depicts extreme competition while still being able to incorporate emotional, dramatic & theatrical aspect to the tale.</p>

              <p class="card-text">A movie by far gripping, excruciating,and touches the height of human endurance and great suffering of a man trapped inside a crevasse. As he fell into the quite crushed under a bolder. The story is how Aron stays alive more than 5days with little food and water . As a mountain climber he tries all ways to free  himself from the crushing boulder and climb out. He is unable to amputate his arm to get freed from the boulder. He stays in delirium dreaming of his friend and parents .finally after 5 days of struggles he breaks his own arm to climb out to the crevasse and get rescued by a helicopter .This is a  must watch movie especially for youth who should always remain positive and hopefully irrespective of hurdles in between.i found it a very motivating and inspiring movie.it teaches us to never give up.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Well, Christopher Nolan is one of the smartest and innovative movie makers of all time. He creates a new concept and gives it his best to execute it well.

                Inception is a classy, stylish, well-acted, and visually beautiful film, which will require your patience and interpretation rather than enthusiasm for action. You will find it, but yes, the film is a slow one. But these kinds of films are supposed to be explained slowly, because that’s the reason why you understand it.
                
                Overall, a very intelligent film</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Lights Out [AUTHOR- ROSHNI ANIL, 11-01-2022, 7.08PM]</h5>
              <p class="card-text">I reccomend everyone to watch this movie. Here's the origin story of Lights Out evil spirit Diana explained. In 2013 director David F. Sandberg and his wife Lotta Losten created a short called Lights Out, which featured Losten as a woman stalked by a spirit that can only be seen in the light. It's an intensely creepy short film that became a viral hit after its online debut and Sandberg later signed on to turn it into a feature-length horror film.</p>
